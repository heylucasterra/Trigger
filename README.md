My Boilerplate
==============

The fuck?
---------

It's a mashup of the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), with some [Normalise.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/), a pinch of the3 [1140 CSS Grid](http://cssgrid.net/), and some of my own HTML & CSS. 

So, the fuck?
-------------

I've found HTML boilerplates are exactly that, and lack certain CSS that I use in almost every project. [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) & [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/) are amazing projects, but they're overkill and heavy. So I rolled my own. 

Simple, lightweight, and most important, it's mine. I've either written or edited pretty much every part of this boilerplate, so I know where everything is, which makes it very easy to edit and add to.
