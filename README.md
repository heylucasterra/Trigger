Trigger
=======


WTF
---

Trigger is a lightweight HTML5 template made to use with [Hammer for Mac](http://hammerformac.com/). If Hammer isn't your thing, I've branched off a non-hammer version of this. 

It's based on [the HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), with some of the guff I never use stripped out, and some [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) & [Bourbon Mixins](http://bourbon.io/) added in.



JavaScript
----------

I've added in a lot of regularly used jQuery to scripts.js. These should be removed if not needed, think of all those sweet, sweet Kb you're saving yo'.



To-dos
------

This is (and probably always will be) a work in progress. Here are some features I'll be adding in.

* Adding in a responsivness with [Bourbon Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/)
