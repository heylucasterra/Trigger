Trigger - 0.2
=============

Branch: Grunt
-------------

Status: Unstable
----------------

* [Bourbon Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) has just been added, and has not been fully tested. 
* Non-hammer branch is not up to date with Master



Uh?
---

Trigger is a lightweight HTML5 & SASS template sitting on top of [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/) to automatically combine and minify all JavaScript, optimise images, and run SASS.

Trigger is based on [the HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), with some of the guff stripped out, and some [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), [Bourbon Mixins](http://bourbon.io/), [Bourbon Neat grid](http://neat.bourbon.io/) & some JavaScript I regularly us, added in.



JavaScript
----------

I've added in a lot of regularly used jQuery to scripts.js. 

* Date injection - For the footer's copyright
* ESC Key listener
* Sticky content after scroll
* Form validation
* Smooth scroll

Plugins

* [jQuery Smartresize](https://github.com/louisremi/jquery-smartresize) - Debounced resize events for jQuery
* [Type Rendering Mix](http://typerendering.com/)

These should be removed if not needed, think of all those sweet, sweet Kb you're saving yo'.



Where's Hammer?
---------------

Yes, Trigger started off life as a [Hammer](http://hammerformac.com/) boilerplate, since the agency I work in has grown and grown, there is less need for me using [Hammer](http://hammerformac.com/). 



To-dos
------

This is (and probably always will be) a work in progress. Here are some features I'll be adding in.

* Get [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) up and running
* [Type Rendering Mix](http://typerendering.com/)
