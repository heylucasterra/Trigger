<h1 id="my-boilerplate">My Boilerplate</h1>

<h2 id="the-fuck">The fuck?</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s a mashup of the <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>, with some <a href="http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/">Normalise.css</a>, a pinch of the3 <a href="http://cssgrid.net/">1140 CSS Grid</a>, and some of my own HTML &amp; CSS. </p>

<h2 id="so-the-fuck">So, the fuck?</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve found HTML boilerplates are exactly that, and lack certain CSS that I use in almost every project. <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> are amazing projects, but they&#8217;re overkill and heavy. So I rolled my own. </p>

<p>Simple, lightweight, and most important, it&#8217;s mine. I&#8217;ve either written or edited pretty much every part of this boilerplate, so I know where everything is, which makes it very easy to edit and add to. </p>
